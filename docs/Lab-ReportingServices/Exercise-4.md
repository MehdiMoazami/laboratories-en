    The pie chart is similar to the column diagram. The _∑ Values_ should be the _LineTotal_, and _Category Groups_ is the _SalesPersonName_. (_Series Groups_ will remain empty this time.)

    Make sure that the legend shows the names. You might need to adjust the size of the diagram to have enough space.
