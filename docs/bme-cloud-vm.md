# Using BME Cloud

If you do not have access to a computer where you can install the required software, you can use BME Cloud to get a temporary virtual machine. We generally recommend that you work on your own machine, as it is faster and more convenient. However, if that is not feasible, you may use the BME Cloud.

Go to <https://cloud.bme.hu> and log in with your EduID. A prepared VM template is available in the "Smallville" data center with the name "Data-driven systems." You can use this template to create a VM that has all the necessary software installed.

You will need an RDP client to connect to the cloud VM.

- Windows has the built-in _Remote Desktop Connection_ software,
- on a Mac, you can use [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop-10/id1295203466?mt=12),
- and on Linux [Remmina](https://remmina.org/how-to-install-remmina/) - or any other RDP-compatible software.

Please note that although being installed already, you may need to [login to Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/support/community-edition-expired-buy-license/) with a Microsoft account (e.g., your @edu.bme.hu account).

!!! note "VM performance"
    Please note that the performance of the VM depends on the usage of the cloud. You may experience a slowdown compared to a performant machine. The exercises can be solved on the VM in due time. You can help the VM by not running multiple Visual Studio instances simultaneously and not opening the browser inside the VM.
